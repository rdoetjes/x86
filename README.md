# x86 Assembler Class
Lessons and example code for the 80x86 Assembler coding course I am writing.

Assembler has arguably become an academic exercise, but the way you need to analyse and solve problems, is still a very usefull exercise. Making you a better coder. As understanding memory, CPU and other hardware, will make you realize how to use them in your higher level languages more efficiently.
Think about avoiding floating points when you only require a certain accuracy. Multipling it so that it can be run in integers is faster. And in this course I hope to show you that.
